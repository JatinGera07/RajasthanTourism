# RajasthanTourism
I along with my team developed a mobile application for Rajasthan Tourism in Rajasthan hackathon 2018. Through this application, we tried to make it easier for anyone visiting Rajasthan to gather information about different domains associated with tourism. Key highlights of application are information about different destinations, History, Night life, Sports etc. of Rajasthan. There is a small quiz related to Rajasthan as well. Moreover, anyone willing to be a tourist guide can apply for the same as well.
